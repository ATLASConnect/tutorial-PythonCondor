# This is an example to automatically create a $TestArea for each release 
#  with the release and project name
#  eg. asetup 16.6.7 would result in 
#        $TestArea = $HOME/athena/AtlasOffline-16.6.7 

[defaults]

# your test area directory
#testarea = /scratch/rcc_mwt2/rcc.z8zfssfXmV/execute.149.165.225.165-6515/dir_12434/athena

# each release has its own directory
#multi = True

# the release dir name has the project prepended
#projtest = True
